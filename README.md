## shehzade.io

This is my personal homepage, served using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for static sites.

The theme used is the [academic](https://github.com/LeNPaul/academic) theme.

## Build

`bundle` is used to bootstrap the dependencies and serve the site:

```
$ bundle install --path vendor/bundle
$ bundle exec jekyll build
```

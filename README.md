# Shehzade.io

This is my personal portfolio website, served using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for static sites.

The [academic](https://github.com/LeNPaul/academic) theme was used for development.

## Build

`bundle` is used to bootstrap the dependencies and serve the site:

```
$ bundle install --path vendor/bundle
$ bundle exec jekyll build
```

## Like what you see?

If you need help recreating this site or something like it, I'd be happy to jump on a call and talk you through some basics!

I'm a __fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Houston__ and an __offensive security consultant__ passionate about red teaming, malware development, and creating open-source security tooling.

Professionally, I've worked with consulting teams on network, web application, and hardware security assessments including source code and host configuration reviews. I've also assisted with writing job scopes and compiling comprehensive engagement reports for a variety of target audiences ranging from highly technical engineers to senior leadership.

I mostly spend my spare time completing security-focused courseware, writing blog posts on my experiences, building and breaking my home lab networks, and researching vulnerabilities in Bluetooth low energy (BLE) devices as well as embedded devices such as smart locks, routers, cameras, and smart home hubs.
